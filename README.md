    <h2 style="">Hi there, I'm Farnaz :computer: Front-End developer</h2>

        Everyone has a story to tell!
        <br/>
         <p>
            At 11 AM, Oct 19, 1993 a girl was born that only angels knew that
            this little girl is going to do great things, girl's parents decided
           to name their daughter <span style="color:red">Farnaz :girl:</span>
          </p>
    <p>
            Hi, I am Farnaz, A girl with a diffrent world, even more complicated
            than Alice's wonderland. My story starts with a box, inside the box
            was something i hadn't even seen in cartoons, My dad told me it's
            name is Computer! but I guessed that his name should have been more
            stranger, just like himself :astonished:
          </p>
    <p>
            With the help of my mom, we setup the computer! As my mom knew how
            to work with it, that made her a hero to me at that time! she told
            me, 'you can play with the computer'. 'Is the computer able to play
            like my freinds?', I asked, :raising_hand:
          </p>
    <p>
            The first time I moved the (my) mouse to do something, I realized
            that the only person in the world who can talk to me is this
            computer. The computer had become my best friend
          </p>
    <p>
            After all these years, my laptop is still my best friend, I called
            him Mr Sandman! he gives answer to all my questions. he teaches me
            new thing. I paint my Ideas with the help of my laptop, then
            invigorate my ideas with the magic (code)!
          </p>
